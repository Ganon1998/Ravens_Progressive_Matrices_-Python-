# Ravens_Progressive_Matrices_-Python-
An agent (A.I.) designed to solve Raven's Progressive Matrices: a visual IQ test.

It's written in Python and uses Pillow, OpenCV, and numpy as libraries. It also uses Pillow's transformation libraries and Dark Pixel Ratios (DPR). 
Contours will probably be implemented in the coming weeks.
